redis-openshift-example
=======================

This git repository is an example on how to have Redis on Red Hat OpenShift
Express. The .openshift directory contains the
necessary build action_hook to download Redis source code and build from scratch.

Running on OpenShift
--------------------

Create an account at http://openshift.redhat.com/

Create a Openshift application (using any application name you want)

    rhc app create -a yourproject -t ruby-1.8

(Note: ruby-1.8 is just an example)

Add this upstream polyglot repository

    cd your_project
    git remote add redis -m master git://github.com/bjjay/redis-openshift-example.git
    git pull -s recursive -X theirs redis master

Then push the repo upstream

    git push

That's it! Now you have simple Ruby application (in this case) with Redis
server. The first deploy takes a bit longer as the necessary libraries and tarballs are
downloaded to your OpenShift instance, so grab a cup of coffee and after a
minute or two test that your application deployed correctly by going to

    http://yourapplication-$yourdomain.rhcloud.com/ruby/

Verify you see a "Hello from Ruby!" page served.
Congratulations! You're up and running with your application, Redis on
OpenShift.
